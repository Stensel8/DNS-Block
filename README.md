# 🎯 DNS Blocklists for Privacy, Anti-AI, and Anti-Tracking

This is my personal DNS blocklist, used in combination with **NextDNS** to protect myself and my family against unwanted tracking, unnecessary AI background activity, advertisements, scam websites, and telemetry. It’s tailored to block what *I* consider shady, sketchy, or just plain invasive.

> **If I want to use AI services, I'm doing that whenever I want. Not when they want. I want to use AI on my own and not in the background, tracking me and collecting my data.**

### 📊 Results

By using these methods (including DNS blocking, DoH/DoT, and firewall rules), my network blocks between **22–37%** of all traffic on average. That’s thousands of tracking/telemetry requests stopped before they even leave the device.
